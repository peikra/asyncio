This project demonstrates how to asynchronously fetch 77 posts from an API using Python's `aiohttp` and `asyncio` libraries.
The retrieved posts are saved to a JSON file.

Features
- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: Uses `aiohttp` for making asynchronous requests.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Fetches data in parallel, speeding up the process.
- **JSON File Output**: Saves the fetched posts to a `.json` file.
